## Lightbulb Challenge -->

**Part 1**  
Branch name: `setup-off-on`
<!-- - User story: I can navigate to localhost:3000 in the browser and see a React application. -->
<!-- - User story: The app has a header and a square on the screen with the word "off" in the middle. -->
I spent to much time on styling the box, then reminded my self that 
<!-- - User story: When I click the square the word toggles from "off" to "on" and then back to "off" again. -->
<!-- - User story: When the lightbulb is "off" the background color of the box is white. When the lightbulb is "on" the background color of the box is yellow. -->

**Part 2**  
Branch name: `assets-switch`

<!-- - User story: Instead of seeing a box, I see a picture of a light switch in the "off" position. -->
<!-- - User story: When I click the light switch the image toggles from an image in the "off" position to an image in the "on" position and then back to "off" again. -->  I struggled making the file path work the for the images.  I had to get the images to carry over directly from my computer.  I also saw some really good toggle swicthes online, but I don't know if I am able to use them?  Is there copyright laws for using code that someone else wrote, or is there palgerisum.
<!-- - User story: When the light switch is "off" I see a white (unlit) lightbulb. When I turn the switch "on" I see a yellow (lit) lightbulb. -->

**Part 3: STRETCH**  
Branch name: `add-remove-lightbulbs`

<!-- - User story: I can see two buttons. One that will add a light switch and one that will remove a light switch.
- User story: When I click the button to add a light switch a can see another light switch with its accompanying lightbulb. All the switches operate independently of each other.
- User story: I can click a button to remove a light switch with its accompanying lightbulb. -->

-change the img alt to reflect a lit/unlit light buld same with toggle swicth
-only make the remove button aviable when there is something to remove
-centering the buttons
-toggle and bulbs next to each other
